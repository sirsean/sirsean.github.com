Today the amaryllis went from 2 flowers to 4, and they look like they're getting both bigger and redder. <br />&nbsp;<br />And just for the record, there's another stalk that's really shooting up right now. Certainly could be blooming in the next couple of days.<p><a href='http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/sirsean/801NfRTFRIoPIpjD35eeJL0or6T5Tt5lHDZGUumJEyEnhQoew0BNpAh6KToD/photo.jpg'><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/sirsean/EF0kRTJkXHvNKE551QXW8oPss0qMjnmAXfdb9gaPH3UtXVXLZmfmuUUojXEN/photo.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="375"/></a> </p><p style="font-size: 10px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>   from <a href="http://sirsean.posterous.com/bam-more-blooming">sirsean.posterous</a>  </p>
