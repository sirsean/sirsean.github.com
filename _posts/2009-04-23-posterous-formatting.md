I've noticed that when you have Posterous autopost to a Wordpress blog, the formatting doesn't really work out that well. At least from Gmail. <br />&nbsp;<br />The iPhone mail client seems to work just fine, though that's probably because you can't do much formatting. In Gmail, if you turn off formatting and just do plain text, it's a little better, but it puts in line breaks where it shouldn't. <br />&nbsp;<br />I find this pretty irritating. It basically means that I'll only be able to use Posterous as a mobile blogging service. Which I guess I don't mind. I couldn't do that before. <br />&nbsp;<br />Still, I wish the Gmail-Posterous-Wordpress workflow worked better.<p style="font-size: 10px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>   from <a href="http://sirsean.posterous.com/posterous-formatting-0">sirsean.posterous</a>  </p>
