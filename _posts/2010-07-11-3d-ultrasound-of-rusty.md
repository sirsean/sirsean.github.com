So we went to have some 3D ultrasound images taken this weekend, which I'd never heard of before. The idea of it, though, is pretty cool. I don't know if you've ever seen an ultrasound happen, but the basic concept is that they take a slice image that you can see; sure, it lets you see more than you would without the ultrasound at all, but it also leaves quite a bit to the imagination. Some people can't tell what's going on at all.

But if you take those slices and let a computer reconstruct them into a 3D image, it looks much better. You'll probably be able to tell what you're looking at. Watch this:
