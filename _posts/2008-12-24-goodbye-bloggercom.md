Another blog is born.

I've gotten fed up with trying to use Blogger. I've been posting there, on and off, for a couple of years now. And this week, I tried to go back in and post something, and they were having technical problems that prevented me from being able to create a new post.

So I thought, what the hell am I doing? I'll just do this on my own. And that's where we are.

I'm going to use this one to post my thoughts and whatever I feel like ... and this will also be where I post anything about programming, now that I'm no longer using the Sean Code blog.

Hopefully I'll also be able to do a better job of posting regularly.
