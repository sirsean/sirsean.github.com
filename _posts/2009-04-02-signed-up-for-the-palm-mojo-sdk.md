So I signed up for the Palm WebOS Mojo SDK preview today. They asked what application I'm planning to write once I get it, so I told them about a mobile client for Things I Did. I think it'd be cool, and I was planning to make such a client once I got the Pre; my main fear is that they'll be as apathetic toward that application as everyone else is. Either way, I'm still pretty excited to get the Pre.

Also, I got around to watching the Pre walkthrough video they released this week. It still looks a little buggy, and it also looks just as slow to open applications as the iPhone is. Hopefully it's smoother to use than it looks in the videos. I think I'm going to have to use one in a store before I actually buy one. That's something I've never done for a phone before, including the iPhone.

Will I get access to the Mojo SDK? Stay tuned.
