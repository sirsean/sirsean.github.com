This annoying rainout at Fenway has given me the opportunity to try some things out, and one of them is getting to know Posterous. One of the main things I want from it is to be able to post from it to multiple blogs, and being able to choose which one to post to.Â <div>  <br /></div><div>I&#39;ve set up autoposting to two of my blogs thus far, and I&#39;m somewhat curious as to which ones (if any) this will get posted to.</div><div><br /></div><div>After this I&#39;ll be trying to control which blog it goes to. If it can do that, I&#39;ll be pleased.</div><p style="font-size: 10px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>   from <a href="http://sirsean.posterous.com/testing-sending-posterous-to-a-blog">Sean's posterous</a>  </p>
