So I've decided to start using [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to post on here, as a nice little test. The visual editor has been getting more and more annoying, and I want to see how well this works.

> The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a _publishing_ format; Markdown is a _writing_ format. Thus, Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.

Sounds good to me.

And if it works out here, I might start using it on the other blogs. Which would be nice ... I don't really want to have a radically different editor for each different blog. If I can post enough on here to be able to tell how it's working, I'll probably mention how the transition goes.

That is all.
