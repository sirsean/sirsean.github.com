I've discovered how you can post to different blogs, at will, through Posterous. And frankly, I think it's fantastic. I look forward to a lot more posting of crap from my iPhone, because let's go ahead and be honest: 140 characters isn't enough space. It's much easier to open up the email app and throw down whatever I feel like saying without having to worry about that pesky little number in the corner telling you how many more times you're allowed to hit the buttons. <br />&nbsp;<br />The best thing about computers is the ability to hit buttons, and I don't think that ability should be limited in any way. Especially artificially. <br />&nbsp;<br />I'm not going to lie, I'm really enjoying Posterous so far. It seems to me that a lot more people should be using this.<p style="font-size: 10px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>   from <a href="http://sirsean.posterous.com/untitled-40538">sirsean.posterous</a>  </p>
