Counting Hero is a mobile app for kids, designed to help them learn to count.

The way it works is that you start with "one", and you have to drag one red orb from the left and drop it onto the sun on the right. Once you do that, the orb returns to its original spot and you move on to "two", and you have to drag two orbs onto the sun. You drag them one at a time, and the app counts out loud along with you.

You can count up to ten, and then it's time to start over.

For what it's worth, my son loves it. He finds the logo and opens it on his own, and he drags the orbs onto the sun. I hope it's helping him to develop an interest in counting, and in numbers.

It's available for Android and for iOS. It works on phones and tablets.
