Fun Balloon is a game for children, in which they pop balloons.

Each time they pop a balloon, the app audibly tells them what color they popped. Each time a balloon pops, a little bit more time is added; when you run out of time, you have to start over.

There's no such thing as "winning" or "losing", though. The important thing is having fun and popping balloons.

This is another one that my son loves to play. He opens it and plays at least once every day.
