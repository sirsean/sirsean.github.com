My name is Sean Schulte; I live in Chicago, and am a computer programmer and a big sports fan. (To give you an idea of how that’s going for me, I’m a fan of the Twins and the Vikings. So … not great.)

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in Computer Science.

In the past I’ve started my own company (Dayraven; a Javascript seating chart application for classrooms) and worked as the lead developer for another startup (ZedZone; a social networking site), and currently work at a more established company (Trustwave; an internet security company).

At work, I write Java and Ruby, and do mobile security research. At home, I write Ruby for server-side stuff, and also Java for Android apps and Objective-C for iOS apps.
